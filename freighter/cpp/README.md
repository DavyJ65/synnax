**Setting up the Dev Environment**

* Bazel: The build system. For more information on how Bazel's build system works, see: https://bazel.build/
  * Installation:
    * MacOS: https://bazel.build/install/os-x`
    * Windows: https://bazel.build/install/windows
    * Linux: https://bazel.build/install/u
  * Usage:
    * Building with Bazel is easy! Just `cd` into `synnax/freighter/cpp`, where the `WORKSPACE` file is found. From there, the library can be built entirely with `bazel build //src:freighter`
