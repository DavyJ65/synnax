So what is the problem?

We're starting to add data writing (control) as well as data reading into the UI. This
comes with many new requirements, and doesn't fit remarkably well into the current
read-focused architecture.

Major Differences:

* The read pipeline requires implementing efficient caching mechanisms,
the write pipeline has no caching involved.
* The write pipeline has to deal with control authority.
* They call different methods on the underlying client.

Other than the fact that they both communicate with the server, they share little in common.
They also share a common telem API o the vis side.

We also have common operators that allow for transformation of data.
