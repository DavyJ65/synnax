There are a few, simple patterns for writing telemetry to a cluster. This page will walk
you through each one in detail.

## Prerequisites

This page assumes you’ve already:

1. Started a Synnax cluster.
2. Familiarized yourself with channels, domains, arrays, and frames.
3. Know how to create channels in a cluster.

### The Simplest Write - Fixed Rate

Writing to a fixed rate channel is as simple as providing the channel’s `write` method
with a numpy array and a timestamp marking the first sample in the array. We’ll start
off by instantiating our client and creating a fixed rate channel.

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Create the channel
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my-precise-tc",
    data_type=np.float32, # Define the data type of the channel using numpy!
    rate=25 * sy.HZ,
)
```

Next, we’ll generate a random array and define a starting timestamp for the first sample.

```python
# Create one minute of random samples.
data = np.random.rand(1500, dtype=np.float32)
start = datetime.now()
```

Finally, we'll write to the channel:

```python
ch.write(start, data)
```

This writes will create a new domain with:

1. A starting timestamp starting at `start`.
2. An ending time stamp one minute later.
3. Our provided array as its telemetry.

### The Simplest Write - Variable Rate

Writing telemetry to a variable rate channel is slightly more complicated. We need to
create two channels: an index channel to store timestamps and another to store thermocouple
values.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a time channel to store the timestamps
time_index_channel = client.channels.create(
    name="time",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP, # Must be a timestamp channel
    is_index=True,
)

# Create an indexed thermocouple channel that stores 32-bit floats
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my-precise-tc",
    data_type=np.float32, # Define the data type of the channel using numpy!
    index=time_index_channel.key, # Index channel that stores timestamps
)
```

Next, we need to define two arrays: one containing our data and another containing the
timestamps for our data.

```python
start = sy.TimeStamp.now()

# Contains int64 nanosecond UTC timestamps
timestamps = np.linspace(
    start,
    start + 60 * sy.TimeSpan.SECOND,
    num=n_samples,
    dtype=np.int64,
)

# Introduce a litle bit of random noise to illustrate irregularly spaced timestamps
variability = np.random.randint(
    5 * TimeSpan.MILLISECOND,
    100 * TimeSpan.MILLISECOND,
    n_samples,
    dtype=np.int64
)
timestamps = timestamps + variability

# Generate some thermocouple data
tc_data = np.random.rand(n_samples)
```

When we write our data, keep in mind that we need to write timestamp data followed by
sensor data. Synnax ensures that we write data to our index before we’re allowed to
write to the channels indexed by it. If we do the opposite, the database will let us know
that our index is discontinuous at the point we’re writing to it. So, first timestamps,
then values.

```python
# First we write to the index. In this case, the starting timestamp of our channels data
# is the same as it's first sample.
time_index_channel.write(timestamps[0], timestamps)

# Then, we write our temperature readings starting at the same timestamp.
my_precise_tc.write(timestamps[0], tc_data)
```

### Multi-Channel Writes using DataFrames

In the previous examples, we saw how to write telemetry to a channel using the `.write()`
method. When writing to multiple channels, it’s inefficient to make separate calls for
each channel’s data. Instead, it’s preferrable to write all channels’ data in a single
request. We can accomplish this by defining a pandas `DataFrame` and writing it instead.

#### Writing to an Index Channel and its Index

We’ll refactor our previous example to write the data for both our `time` index and
`my-precise-tc` sensor channel in a single request.

```python
# ... assuming that both channels have been created and we've instantiated our data.
import pandas as pd

# Package our data into a single frame.
data = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({
    "time": timestamps,
    "my-precise-tc": tc_data,
})

# Notice how we use the client here instead of our channels themselves
client.write_frame(timestamps[0], data)
```

## Long Lived, Streaming Writes

Purpose built for live telemetry, Synnax provides a ‘writer’ entity for writing large
volumes of data over an extended period of time. Using long writes allows you to write
many frames of telemetry to a single domain.

### Writing Several Frames to an Index Channel and its Index

We’ll refactor, except this time we’ll use a writer and pass several frames to it.

```python
start = datetime.now()

# A function that mocks random sensor data for sixty seconds.
def fetch_sensor_data() -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    data_start = datetime.now()
    timestamps = np.linspace(
        data_start,
        data_start + 5 * sy.TimeSpan.SECOND,
        num=n_samples,
        dtype=np.int64,
    )
    data = np.randon.rand(n_samples)
    return timestamps, data

writer = client.new_writer(start=start, names=['time', 'my-precise-c'])

try:
    # Sample for 50 seconds
    for i in range(10)
        # Sleep 5 seconds to simulate recording
        time.sleep(5)
        # Fetch sensor data
        timestamps, data = fetch_sensor_data()
        # Write it.
        writer.write(pd.DataFrame.from_dict({
            "time": timestamps,
            "my-precise-tc": data,
        })
    # Commit the domain, persisting all writes to the database
    writer.commit()
finally:
    writer.close()
```

It’s important to close a writer after you’re done with it, so we reccommend wrapping
it’s usage in a try-except clause with a call to `close` in the finally block.
