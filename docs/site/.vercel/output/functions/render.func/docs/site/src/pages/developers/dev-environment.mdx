# Setting up your Development Environment

This page takes you through the steps of setting up your computer to develop
Synnax. Instructions are available for both MacOS and Windows. The guide first
takes you through installing the base tooling necessary for working on any project,
and then steps into frontend, backend, and client specific tooling. After you've
installed the base tools, you can skip to the section for the part of the project
you're working on.

## Base Tooling

:::caution
If you have already completed any of these steps, you can skip them. Although all of these
tools are safe, installing may cause some unintended side effects for other projects.
:::

### Install Homebrew

The easiest way to set up your development environment is by using
the macOS package manager [**Homebrew**](https://brew.sh/), which you can install by running the following
command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Clone The Git Repository

The next step is to clone the git repository. If you don't already have git installed,
you can do so by running:

```bash
brew install git
```

After that, clone the repository by running the following command in a direcory
of your choice (we recommend `~/projects`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax && cd synnax
```

### Install Docker

The next step is to install [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/), which is a
containerization platform that allows us to run Synnax in a consistent, sandboxed
environment. We also use it for all of our builds and CI/CD pipelines.

:::caution
This part can be tricky, feel free to reach out if you run into any trouble.
:::

```bash
brew install --cask docker
```

To make sure docker is working, run the following command:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

If you see this message as part of the output, you're good to go:

```bash
Hello from Docker!
```

### Install Earthly

The next step is to install [**Earthly**](https://earthly.dev/), which is an
automation tool that allows us to build Synnax in a consistent, reproducible way.
It uses Docker under the hood, and is a nice, modern alternative to Makefiles.

To install Earthly, run the following command:

```bash
brew install earthly/earthly/earthly && earthly bootstrap
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
earthly github.com/earthly/hello-world+hello
```

## Backend Tooling

### Install Go

The next step is to install [**Go**](https://golang.org/), which is the programming
language we use for our backend code. We use the latest version of Go 1.19, which
you can install by running:

```bash
brew install go
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
go version
```

The output should look something like this:

```bash
go version go1.19 darwin/amd64
```

### Run a Test Suite

Next, let's check that the test cases compile and execute correctly. From the
root level of the repository, run:

```bash
cd x && go test -v ./...
```

You should see a bunch of light green output.

## Frontend Tooling

### Install Node.js

The first step is to install [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/), which is the
JavaScript runtime we use for our frontend code. We use the latest version,
which you can install by running:

```bash
brew install node
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
node -v
```

The output should look something like this:

```bash
v18.[X].[Y]
```

### Install Yarn

The next step is to install [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/), which is the package
manager we use for managing our frontend dependencies. You can install it by running:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

Check the installation by running:

```bash
yarn --version
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
1.22.[X]
```

### Run the Documentation Website

To ensure that all the frontend tooling is working well, let's run the documentation
website. From the root level of the repository, run:

```bash
cd docs/site && earthly +dev
```

This might take a while to run the first time, but should eventually open a browser
window on `localhost:3000` with the documentation website. You can use `Ctrl+C` to
stop the server.

## Client Tooling

### Install Python

The first step is to install [**Python**](https://www.python.org/), which is the
programming language we use for our client code. We use the latest version of Python 3
(3.10), which you can install by running the following command:

```bash
brew install python@3.10
```

If you get a `permissiond denied` error, you may need to run the command using
`sudo`. To verify the installation, run:

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
Python 3.10.[X]
```

If you see a different version, you may need to update your `PATH` environment variable.
If this happens, let us know so we can help you out.

### Install Poetry

We use [**Poetry**](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage our Python dependencies.
To install it, run:

```bash
pip install poetry
```

To verify the installation, run the following command in the root directory of the
repository:

```bash
cd client/py && poetry install
```

This should install all dependencies for the client. If you get an error
saying that `poetry` is not a command, you may need to update your `PATH` environment
variable. If this happens, let us know so we can help you out.

## Base Tooling

### Install WSL

Right now, the only way to develop Synnax on Windows is by using WSL. If you haven't
already installed it, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

If you've already installed WSL, make sure you're using version 2 by running:

```bash
wsl -l -v
```

If you're using an Ubuntu distribution (the default), you should see something
like this:

```bash
  NAME                   STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu                 Running         2
```

### Clone the Git Repository

The next step is to clone the Synnax repository. Make sure you're
using a WSL terminal. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
wsl
```

From here on, **assume all commands should be run within WSL**. Now, move
into a directory of your choice, we recommend making a directory called `projects`
in your home directory.

```bash
cd ~ && mkdir projects && cd projects
```

You're free to choose any directory you want as long as it's on your WSL filesystem.
After you've created the directory, clone the git repository by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax
```

### Install Docker

:::caution
This part can be tricky, especially on Windows. feel free to reach out if you run
into any trouble.
:::

The next step is to install [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/), which is a
containerization platform that allows us to run Synnax in a consistent, sandboxed
environment. We also use it for all our builds and CI/CD pipelines.

The instructions for installing Docker Desktop can be found
[here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/). This is a specific guide
for using Docker with the WSL 2 engine.

After installing, make sure Docker is working by running:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

You should see the following as part of the output:

```bash
Hello from Docker!
```

### Install Earthly

The next step is to install [**Earthly**](https://earthly.dev/), which is a build
automation tool that allows us to build Synnax in a consistent, reproducible way.
It uses Docker under the hood, and is a nice, modern alternative to Makefiles.

To install Earthly, run the following command:

```bash
sudo /bin/sh -c 'wget https://github.com/earthly/earthly/releases/latest/download/earthly-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/earthly && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/earthly && /usr/local/bin/earthly bootstrap --with-autocomplete'
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
earthly github.com/earthly/hello-world+hello
```

## Backend Tooling

### Install Go

The next step is to install [**Go**](https://golang.org/), which is the programming
language we use for of our backend code. We use the latest version of Go 1.19,
which you can download by running:

```bash
wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.19.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Then, to extract the archive and install it, run:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.19.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

You may be prompted for your password.

The final step is to add `/usr/local/go/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable.
You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
echo PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin >> ~/.profile && source ~/.profile
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
go version
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
go version go1.19.1 linux/amd64
```

### Run a Test Suite

Next, let's check that the test cases compile and execute correctly. From the
root level of the repository (in our case, `~/projects/synnax`), run:

```bash
cd x && go test -v ./...
```

You should see a bunch of light green output.

## Frontend Tooling

### Install Node.js

The first step is to install [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/), which is the
JavaScript runtime we use for our frontend code. The first step is add the latest
version of Node.js to your package manager by running:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
```

Then, to install Node.js, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
node --version
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
v18.[X].[Y]
```

### Install Yarn

We use [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manage our JavaScript dependencies.
To install it, run:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
yarn --version
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
1.22.[X]
```

### Run the Documentation Website

To ensure that all the frontend tooling is working well, let's run the documentation
website. From the root level of the repository, run:

```bash
cd docs/site && earthly +dev
```

This might take a while to run the first time, but should eventually open a browser
window on `localhost:3000` with the documentation website. You can use `Ctrl+C` to
stop the server.

## Client Tooling

### Install Python

The first step is to install [**Python**](https://www.python.org/), which is the
programming language we use for our client code. We use the latest version of Python 3 (3.10).
To install it, we first need to update our package index by running:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install software-properties-common && sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
```

You may need to press `Enter` to continue. Then, to install Python, run:

```bash
sudo apt install python3.10
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
python3.10 --version
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
Python 3.10.[X]
```

Next, run:

```
python --version
```

If you see something different from `Python 3.10.[X]`, you may need to update your
`PATH` environment variable. Let us know if this is happens so we can help you
resolve it.

### Install Poetry

We use [**Poetry**](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage our Python dependencies.
To install it, run:

```bash
pip install poetry
```

To verify the installation, run the following command in the root directory of the
repository:

```bash
cd client/py && poetry install
```

This should install all dependencies for the client. If you get an error
saying that `poetry` is not a command, you may need to update your `PATH` environment
variable. If this happens, let us know so we can help you out.

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed all the tooling, you're ready to start contributing to
Synnax. Project specific development instructions can be found in the `README.md`
files in each project directory.
