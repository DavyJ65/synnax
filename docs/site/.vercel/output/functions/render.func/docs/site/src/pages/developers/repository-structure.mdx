# Repository Structure

Synnax is built as a collection of several different projects, all of which are collected
in a single [GitHub repository](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/). The following
is a list of the projects and their purpose:

- [Aspen](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/aspen) - A gossip based
  distributed key-value store used for propagating and persisting metadata between
  nodes, such cluster topology, state, and configuration. The core RFC for Aspen
  is available [here](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/rfc/2-220518-aspen-distributed-storage).
- [Cesium](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/cesium) - An embedded
  time-series engine optimized for high performance reads and writes of regular telemetry. The
  core RFC for Cesium is available [here](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/rfc/1-220517-cesium-segment-storage).
- [Client](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client) - Client libraries
  for synnax available in multiple languages. The implementation for each language
  is a subpackage of the client package.
- [Documentation](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/docs) - The technical
  and user-facing documentation for Synnax. Contains the code for the Synnax documentation
  website, technical RFCs, and additonal media such as logos.
- [Freighter](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/freighter) - A protocol
  agnostic network transport for cross-language unary and streaming communication. Freighter
  has implementations in several languages; each implementation is container in a
  sub-directory of the freighter service. The core RFC for Freighter is available [here](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/rfc/6-220809-freighter).
- [Pluto](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/pluto) - A React component
  library for building the Synnax user interfaces. This package includes theming
  standards (primary colors, grays, errors, fonts, etc.).
- [Synnax](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/synnax) - The core Synnax
  server, which integrates all other services to provide a complete telemetry system.
- [Cluster UI](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/synnax/pkg/ui) - A React
  application for interacting with and managing the Synnax cluster.
- [X](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/x) - The common utilities
  used across all Synnax services.
