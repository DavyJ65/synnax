# Setting up your Development Environment

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="macOS" label="MacOS">
```

## Base Tooling

The following tools need to be installed regardless of the project you're working on.
After that, we'll step into project specific tooling.

:::caution
If you have already completed any of these steps, you can skip them. Although all of these
tools are safe, installing may cause some unintended side effects for other projects.
:::

### Homebrew

The easiest way to set up your development environment is by using
the macOS package manager [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), which you can install by running the following
command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

The next step is to install **Git**, which you can do by running the following command:

### Git

```bash
brew install git
```

After that, it's time to clone the Synnax repository. Run the following command in a
directory of your choice:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax && cd synnax
```

### Docker

The next step is to install [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/), which is a
containerization platform that allows you to run Synnax in a consistent, sandboxed
environment. We also use it for all our builds and CI/CD pipelines.

:::caution
This part can be tricky, feel free to reach out if you run into any trouble.
:::

```bash
brew install --cask docker
```

To make sure docker is working, run the following command:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

If you see this message as part of the output, you're good to go:

```bash
Hello from Docker!
```

### Earthly

The next step is to install [**Earthly**](https://earthly.dev/), which is a build automation tool that
allows us to build Synnax in a consistent, reproducible way. It uses Docker under the hood,
and is a nice, modern alternative to Makefiles.

To install Earthly, run the following command:

```bash
brew install earthly/earthly/earthly && earthly bootstrap
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
earthly github.com/earthly/hello-world+hello
```

## Backend Tooling

### Go

The next step is to install [**Go**](https://golang.org/), which is the programming language we use for
most of our backend code. We use the latest version of Go 1.19, which you can install
by running the following command:

```bash
brew install go
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
go version
```

The output should look something like this:

```bash
go version go1.19 darwin/amd64
```

Next, let's check that the test cases compile and execute correctly. From the
root level of the repository, run:

```bash
cd x && go test -v ./...
```

## Frontend Tooling

### Node.js

The first step is to install [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/), which is the
JavaScript runtime we use for our frontend code. We use the latest version of Node.js,
which you can install by running the following command:

```bash
brew install node
```

### Yarn

The next step is to install [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/), which is a package
manager for Node.js:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

Check the installation by running:

```bash
yarn --version
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
1.22.[X]
```

## Client Tooling

### Python

The next step is to install [**Python**](https://www.python.org/), which is the programming language we use for
our client code. We use the latest version of Python 3 (3.10), which you can install by
running the following command:

```bash
brew install python
```

To verify the installation, run

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
Python 3.10.[X]
````

### Poetry


```mdx-code-block

```

## Base Tooling

### WSL

The only way to develop Synnax on Windows is by using WSL. If you haven't already,
follow the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

If you've already installed WSL, make sure you're running version 2. To see whether
your linux distribution is set to version 2, run:

```bash
wsl -l -v
```

If you're running Ubuntu (the default), you should see something like this:

```bash
  NAME                   STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu                 Running         2
```

### Clone the Git Repository

The next step is to clone the Synnax repository. Before cloning, make sure you're
using a WSL terminal. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
wsl
```

From here on, assume all commands should be run within a WSL terminal. Now, move
into a directory of your choice, we recommend making a directory called `projects`
in your home directory.

```bash
cd ~ && mkdir projects && cd projects
```

You're free to choose any directory you want, but make sure it's on your WSL
filesystem. After that, clone the repository by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax
```

Now it's time to install docker.

### Docker

:::caution
This part can be tricky, especially on Windows. feel free to reach out if you run
into any trouble.
:::

The next step is to install [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/), which is a
containerization platform that allows you to run Synnax in a consistent, sandboxed
environment. We also use it for all our builds and CI/CD pipelines.

The instructions for installing Docker desktop can be found
[here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/). It's important that you
run Docker using the WSL backend.

To make sure docker is working, run the following command within WSL:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

### Earthly

The next step is to install [**Earthly**](https://earthly.dev/), which is a build automation tool that
allows us to build Synnax in a consistent, reproducible way. It uses Docker under the hood,
and is a nice, modern alternative to Makefiles.

To install Earthly, run the following command:

```bash
sudo /bin/sh -c 'wget https://github.com/earthly/earthly/releases/latest/download/earthly-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/earthly && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/earthly && /usr/local/bin/earthly bootstrap --with-autocomplete'
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
earthly github.com/earthly/hello-world+hello
```
