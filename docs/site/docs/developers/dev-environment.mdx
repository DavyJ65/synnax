# Setting up your Development Environment

## Base Tooling
---

The following tools need to be installed regardless of the project you're working on.
After that, we'll step into project specific tooling.

:::caution
If you have already completed any of these steps, you can skip them. Although all of these
tools are safe, installing may cause some unintended side effects for other projects.
:::

### Homebrew

The easiest way to set up your development environment is by using
the macOS package manager [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), which you can install by running the following
command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

The next step is to install **Git**, which you can do by running the following command:

### Git

```bash
brew install git
```

After that, it's time to clone the Synnax repository. Run the following command in a
directory of your choice:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax
```

### Docker

The next step is to install [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/), which is a containerization platform that
allows you to run Synnax in a consistent, sandboxed environment. We also use it
for all our builds and CI/CD pipelines.

:::caution
This part can be tricky, feel free to reach out if you run into any trouble.
:::

```bash
brew install --cask docker
```

To make sure docker is working, run the following command:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

If you see this message as part of the output, you're good to go:

```bash
Hello from Docker!
```

### Earthly

The next step is to install [**Earthly**](https://earthly.dev/), which is a build automation tool that
allows us to build Synnax in a consistent, reproducible way. It uses Docker under the hood,
and is a nice, modern alternative to Makefiles.

To install Earthly, run the following command:

```bash
brew install earthly/earthly/earthly && earthly bootstrap
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
earthly github.com/earthly/hello-world+hello
```

## Backend Tooling
---

### Go

The next step is to install [**Go**](https://golang.org/), which is the programming language we use for
most of our backend code. We use the latest version of Go 1.19, which you can install
by running the following command:

```bash
brew install go
```

## Frontend Tooling
---

### Node.js

The next step is to install [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/), which is the JavaScript
runtime we use for our frontend code. We use the latest version of Node.js, which you
can install by running the following command:

```bash
brew install node
```

### Yarn

### Installing and Linking Dependencies

## Client Tooling
---

### Python

The next step is to install [**Python**](https://www.python.org/), which is the programming language we use for
our client code. We use the latest version of Python 3 (3.10), which you can install by
running the following command:

```bash
brew install python
```

To verify the installation, run

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
Python 3.10.[X]
````
