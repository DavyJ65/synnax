# Resources

The following is a collection of useful resources for developing data intensive distributed
systems. They are organized by category, but some resources may be relevant to multiple categories.

## Data Processing

### Martin Kleppmann  - Designing Data-Intensive Applications

**Link**: [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/)

A one thousand page behemoth that peers under the hood of large scale data-processing
systems like Linux, Spark, Hadoop + HDFS, GFS, SQL, NoSQL. It introduces some of the
fundamental concepts of distributed systems, like ACID Compliance, CAP Theorem, and
Serializability. It also covers some of the history behind the significant players in
the space, and how the solutions have changed over time.

## Data Storage

### Fireship - Seven Database Paradigms

**Link**: [Seven Database Paradigms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Z7fbCLSTw&ab_channel=Fireship)

An introduction to seven of the most common database paradigms and where they should be
used. Short, sweet, and to the point.

### CockroachDB - Architecture Resources and Documentation

CockroachDB is a strongly consistent, distributed SQL database. Synnax takes quite a bit
of inspiration from its high level architecture and its codebase. The following is a list
of resources detailing CockroachDB's architecture, as well as some important RFCs that
were used as inspiration for Synnax's design:

* [CockroachDB Architecture Overview](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/overview.html)
* Video - [CockroachDB, Architecture of a Geo-Distributed SQL Database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJySfiMKXLs&ab_channel=DataCouncil)
* RFC - [CockroachDB: Distributed SQL](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/RFCS/20160421_distributed_sql.md)


### Spanner - Google's Globally Distributed Database

[Spanner: Googleâ€™s Globally Distributed Database](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/65b514eda12d025585183a641b5a9e096a3c4be5.pdf)

Developed at Google to help power their search engine, Spanner is, in many ways, the
mother of all strongly consistent distributed databases. This document summarizes Spanner's
design and provides great background on many of the considerations that go into
working with distributed systems.

## Building Distributed Systems

### Chris Colohan - What is a Distributed System?

**Link**: [What is a Distributed System?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VbL89mKK3M&ab_channel=DistributedSystemsCourse)

A ground introduction to what a distributed system is, why it exists, and some example
of distributed systems in practice.

### Robert Vitillo - Understanding Distributed Systems

**Link**: [Understanding Distributed Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Distributed-Systems-distributed-applications/dp/1838430202/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1YE1QBTR8686N&keywords=understanding+distributed+systems&qid=1638315988&sprefix=Underst%2Caps%2C192&sr=8-1)

An introduction to distributed systems. It leaves you with a good understanding of the
high level components and rules. It covers the following:

* Communication - Reliable Links, Secure Links, Discovery (DNS), and APIs
* Coordination - System Models, Failure Detection, Clocks, Leader Election, Replication, Transactions
* Scalability - Functional Decomposition, Partitioning, Duplication, Caching
* Resiliency - Common Failure Causes, Downstream Resiliency, Upstream Resiliency
* Testing - Continued Integration/Delivery, Monitoring, and Observability

### Marten Van Steen - Distributed Systems

**Link**: [Distributed Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Distributed-Systems-Maarten-van-Steen/dp/1543057381/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=Distributed+Systems&qid=1638315755&sr=8-5)

A deep dive into the fundamental concepts underlying the design of distributed systems.
Contains info on the following categories:

1. Architectural Styles
2. Processes and Basic Concurrency Models
3. Communication - Networking, Protocols, and Architectures
4. Naming and Name Resolution
5. Coordination - Clock Synchronization, Leader Election
6. Consistency and Replication
7. Fault Tolerance
8. Security

## Programming in Go

### FreeCodeCamp - Learn Go Programming

**Link**: [Learn Go Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS4e4q9oBaU&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

A concise, practical introduction to Go. Not much else to say except that its
a great way to get into the language.

### C.A.R. Hoare - Communicating Sequential Processes

**Link**: [PDF - Communicating Sequential Processes](http://www.usingcsp.com/cspbook.pdf)

A deep dive into the theory and mathematics behind Go's concurrency model,
Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP). It's pretty brutal and requires
some knowledge of discrete mathematics, but it's a great read if you want to
understand the mathematics behind writing concurrent programs.

## Writing Great Software

### John K. Ousterhout  - A Philosophy of Software Design

**Link**: [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-2nd-ebook/dp/B09B8LFKQL/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=A+Philosophy+of+Software+Design&qid=1663177481&sr=8-1)

Discusses the fundamental problem in large scale software design: **managing complexity**.
It focuses on patterns and principles for writing software that defines clear
architectural boundaries,  and is built to last.

### Many Authors - Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software

**Link**: [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=sr_1_fkmr3_1?keywords=design+patterns%3A+elements+of+resuable+object-oriented+software&qid=1663177597&sr=8-1-fkmr3)

The bible of software, unless you're a functional programmer. First published in 1994,
this book is a collection of OOP design patterns that form the core of many of the
most resilient software systems on the planet.
