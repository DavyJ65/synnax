# New Developer Guide

This page takes you through the steps of getting started developing Synnax.

The best place to begin is by gaining an understanding of Synnax's purpose
and high level architecture. The [concepts](/concepts) and [architecture](/architecture)
pages provide a good introduction. If you feel like you need more technical details,
the [Technical RFCs](/category/technical-rfcs) gives a deep dive into some of the most important
design topics.

Once you're ready to move on, it's time to start thinking about what part of the
project you'd like to contribute to. All of our issues are tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/issues).
If you're looking for a place to start, check out the [good first issue](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
labels. These projects have relatively small, understandable scopes that let you
get your feet wet with the codebase.

If you don't see anything that interests you, fear not! Take a look at the [repository
structure](/developers/repository-structure) page to see a list of all the
different parts of the project. There's user Interface work in JavaScript and
TypeScript, storage engine and distributed systems work in Go, client and network
transport work in Python, and more. Once you've found something that interests
you (or even if you don't!), reach out to Emiliano (emilbon99@gmail.com) and he'll
help you get started.

After you've found an issue or project, it's time get started with the development
process.
