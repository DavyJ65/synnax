# Get Started

Synnax offers a Python client for communicating with a cluster.

## Pre-requisites

If you don't already have a Synnax cluster up and running, you can get
up to speed with our [Get Started Guide](/).

## Installation

The Python client is available on PyPI, and can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install synnax
```

## Connecting to a Cluster

To connect to a cluster, import the `Client` class and instantiate it with the host and port of a reachable node in
the cluster:

```python
import synnax

client = synnax.Synnax(host="localhost",port=8080)
```

## Write Telemetry

To write telemetry to a cluster, we first need to create a channel. If you're unaware of what a channel is, you can
read more about it [here](/concepts#channel). To create a channel, we use the `.channel.create()` method:

```python
import numpy as np

ch = client.channel.create(
    # A useful name for the channel. This is mostly for human consumption.
    name="my-temperature-sensor",
    # This defines the data rate for the cahnnel. This is the number of
    # samples per second that will be stored.
    rate=25 * synnax.HZ,
    # We're using a built-in data type here. While np.float64 itself isn't an
    # official data type, Synnax can interpret it as a type of telem.FLOAT64.
    data_type=np.float64,
)
```

Once we have a channel, we can write telemetry to it using the `.write()` method:

```python
# ... same imports as above
from datetime import datetime

# Create a numpy array of 1000 random samples.
data = np.random.rand(1000)

# Write the data to the channel. The provided timestamp represents the timestamp for the
# first sample in the array.
start = datetime.now()
ch.write(start, data)
```

```python
import synnax
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime

# Open a client.
client = synnax.Synnax(host="localhost", port=8080)

# Create a channel.
ch = client.channel.create(
    name="my-temperature-sensor",
    rate=25 * synnax.HZ,
    data_type=np.float64,
)

# Write some data to it.
data = np.random.rand(1000)
start = datetime.now()
ch.write(start, data)
```

</details>

## Read Telemetry

Reading telemetry from a channel is as simple as writing to it. To read data from a channel, we use the `.data.read()`
method:

```python
# ... starting from the end of the previous example

# Calculate the ending timestamp for the data we want to read.
end = telem.Timestamp(start) + 40 * synnax.SECOND

# Read the data from the channel. The provided timestamp represents the timestamp for the
# first sample in the array.
res_data = ch.read(start, end)
```

This returns a `numpy.ndarray` of the data that was read from the channel.

```python
  import synnax
  import numpy as np
  from datetime import datetime

  # Open a client.
  client = synnax.Synnax(host="localhost", port=8080)

  # Create a channel.
  ch = client.channel.create(
    name="my-temperature-sensor",
    rate=25 * synnax.HZ,
    data_type=np.float64,
  )

  # Write some data.
  data = np.random.rand(1000)
  start = datetime.now()
  ch.write(start, data)

  # Read it back.
  end = synnax.TimeStamp(start) + 40 * synnax.SECOND
  res_data = ch.read(start, end)
```
