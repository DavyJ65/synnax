# Get Started

Synnax offers a Typescript client for communicating with a cluster.

## Pre-requisites

If you don't already have a Synnax cluster up and running, you can get
up to speed with our [Get Started Guide](/).

## Install the Client

The Typescript client is available on NPM, and can be installed with the following command:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
```

```bash
npm install @synnax/client
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
```

```bash
yarn add @synnaxlabs/client
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Environments

The Synnax typescript client supports both Node.js and the Browser. Choose the
appropriate environment below.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="environment">
<TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">
```

## Connect to a Cluster

To connect to a cluster, import the `Synnax` class and instantiate it with the host and
port of a reachable node in the cluster:

```ts
const {
  Synnax,
  // ... a few extra imports we'll use later
  TimeSpan,
  DataType,
  Rate,
} = require("@synnaxlabs/client");

const client = new Synnax({ host: "localhost", port: 8080 });
```

:::info
The Typescript client uses `async/await` syntax. All the following code is assumed
to be run within an `async` function. See the code summaries at the end of each section
for complete examples.

## Write Telemetry

To write telemetry to a cluster, we first need to create a channel. If you're unaware
of what a channel is, you can read more about it [here](/concepts#channel). To create a
channel, we use the `.channel.create()` method:

```ts
const channel = await client.channel.create({
  // A useful name for the channel. This is mostly for human consumption.
  name: "my-temperature-sensor",
  //  This defines the data rate for the channel. This is the number of samples per
  // second that will be stored.
  rate: Rate.Hz(1),
  // This defines the data type for the channel. All data written to the channel must be
  // of this type.
  type: DataType.Float64,
});
```

Once we have a channel, we can write telemetry to it using the `.write()` method:

```ts
await channel.write(0, new Float64Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]));
```

This writes the values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` to the channel, where the timestamp of the
first value (`1`) is the unix UTC timestamp `0`.

<details>
<summary> <strong> In case you'd like a recap, here's the entire code block.</strong></summary>

```ts
const { Synnax, TimeSpan, DataType, Rate } = require("@synnaxlabs/client");

const client = new Synnax({ host: "localhost", port: 8080 });

async function main() {
  const channel = await client.channel.create({
    name: "my-temperature-sensor",
    rate: Rate.Hz(1),
    type: DataType.Float64,
  });

  await channel.write(0, new Float64Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]));
}
main();
```

This code is complete, and should run as is.

## Read Telemetry

Reading telemetry from a channel is as simple as writing to it. To read data from a channel,
use the `.read()` method:

```ts
const data = await channel.read(0, TimeSpan.Seconds(8));
```

This reads all data from the channel between the unix UTC times 0 and 8 seconds.

<details>
<summary><strong>And here it is all in one simple script.</strong></summary>

```ts
const { Synnax, TimeSpan, DataType, Rate } = require("@synnaxlabs/client");

const client = new Synnax({ host: "localhost", port: 8080 });

async function main() {
  const channel = await client.channel.create({
    name: "my-temperature-sensor",
    rate: Rate.Hz(1),
    type: DataType.Float64,
  });

  await channel.write(0, new Float64Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]));

  const data = await channel.read(0, TimeSpan.Seconds(8));
}
```

This code is complete, and should run as is.
