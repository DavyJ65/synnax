This page shows you how to create channels within a Synnax cluster. Channels can be created
using the Synnax CLI, Delta UI, or any of-the Synnax client libraries.

## Prerequisites

This page assumes you’ve already:

1. [Started a Synnax cluster](/deploy/get-started).
2. [Familiarized yourself with channels](/concepts/channels).

## Channel Parameters

Channels have a few important parameters that need to be set when creating them. The
following list summarizes each one. If you’d like deeper descriptions on each, see [here](/concepts/channels)

1. **Name** - A human-readable name for the channel. We recommend keeping channel names
   unique, although this isn’t a strict requirement by the database.
2. **Data Type** - The data type of the channel. All samples in a channel must have the
   same data type. If the channel is an index channel, it's data type must be a timestamp.
3. **Rate** - The fixed rate at which samples are recorded. If this parameter is specified
   and index and is index are not, the channel is considered a fixed rate channel.
4. **Index** - The key of the channel whose timestamp values will be used to index the
   created channel. If this parameter is specified, then the channel will be an indexed
   channel. If this parameter is specified, the channel is considered an indexed channel,
   and Is Index should not be set to true.
5. **Is Index** - A flag that indicates whether the values in a channel are indexed i.e.
   the channel's values are time-ordered and can be used to lookup the samples
   in another channel. Channels with this flag set to true are considered index channels
   and must have a data type of timestamp. If this parameter is set to true, the channel
   is considered an index and ‘index’ should not be specified.

## Creating a Channel

Now that you've chosen the correct parameters for your channel, you can create it using
any of the following methods:

### Creating a Single, Fixed Rate Channel

The simplest channel to create has a fixed rate.

```python
# Create a fixed rate thermocouple channel that stores 32-bit floats
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my-precise-tc",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    rate=100 * sy.Rate.HZ,
)
```

### Creating an Indexed Channel and it's Index

Creating variable rate channels requires us to create first create an index channel to
store timestamps and then create our data channel.

```python
# Create a time channel to store the timestamps of our indexed channel
time_index_channel = client.channels.create(
    name="time",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP, # must be a timestamp channel
    is_index=True,
)

# Create an indexed channel that stores 32-bit floats
my_precise_tc = client.channels.create(
    name="my-precise-tc"
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=time_index_channel.key, # Pass the key of the index channel here.
)
```

### Creating Multiple Channels

We can also create multiple channels by passing a list to the `create` method. The
important thing to keep in mind is that we need to create index channels before creating
their indexes.

```python
# We need to create index channels before their index,
# so we make a separate call to create here.
time_index = client.channels.create(
    name="time",
    data_type=sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    is_index=true,
)

sensor_one = sy.Channel(
    name="sensor-one",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT32,
    index=time_index.key,
)

sensor_two = sy.Channel(
    name="sensor-two",
    data_type=sy.DataType.FLOAT64,
    index=time_index.key,
)

sensor_three = sy.Channel(
    name="sensor-three",
    data_type=sy.DataType.INT8,
    rate=25 * sy.Rate.KHZ,
)

client.channels.create([
    sensor_one,
    sensor_two,
    sensor_three
])
```

### Creating a Single, Fixed Rate Channel

The simplest channel to create has a fixed rate.

```typescript
import { DataType, Rate } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

// Create a fixed rate channel that stores 32-bit floats
const myPreciseTC = client.channels.create({
    name: "my-precise-tc",
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
    rate: 100 * Rate.HZ,
});
```

### Creating an Indexed Channel and it’s Index

Creating variable rate channels requires us to first create an index channel to store
timestamps and then create our data channel.

```typescript
import { Synnax, DataType, Rate } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const client = new Synnax();

const timeIndexChannel = client.channels.create({
    name: "time",
    dataType: sy.DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    isIndex: true,
});

const myPreciseTC = client.channels.create({
    name: "my-precise-tc",
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
    index: timeIndexChannel.key,
});
```

### Creating Multiple Channels

We can also create multiple channels by passing an array to the `create` method. The
important thing to keep in mind is that we need to create index channels before creating
their indexes.

```typescript
import { Synnax, DataType, Rate, Channel } from "@synnaxlabs/client";

const client = new Synnax();

// We need to create index channels before their index,
// so we make a separate call to create here.
const timeIndex = client.channels.create({
    name: "time",
    dataType: DataType.TIMESTAMP,
    isIndex: true,
});

const sensorOne = new Channel({
    name: "sensor-one",
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT32,
    index: timeIndex.key,
});

const sensorTwo = new Channel({
    name: "sensor-two",
    dataType: DataType.FLOAT64,
    index: timeIndex.key,
});

const sensorThree = new Channel({
    name: "sensor-three",
    dataType: DataType.INT8,
    rate: 25 * Rate.KHZ,
});

client.channels.create([sensorOne, sensorTwo, sensorThree]);
```
