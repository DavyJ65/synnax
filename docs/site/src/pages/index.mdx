# Get Started

If you're new to Synnax and want to get started, this is the place to be! This guide will
walk you through the basics of starting and communicating with a single node cluster.

If you'd like to know more about the high level concepts of Synnax (i.e. _What is Synnax?_),
check out the [FAQ](../faq) or the [Concepts](../concepts) page.

If you're interested in contributing to Synnax, check out the [New Developer Guide](../developers/new-developer-guide)
and read through our [Technical RFCs](../category/technical-rfcs).

## Starting a Single Node Cluster

The easiest way to get started with synnax is by pulling the docker image and running it
locally. To do this, you'll need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
and running.

To start a single node, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 synnaxlabs/synnax --listen=localhost:8080 --mem --insecure
```

This will pull the latest version of Synnax from docker hub and start a single node
with the following parameters:

`bash -p 8080:8080` - This maps the port 8080 on your local machine to the port 8080 on the
docker container. This allows you to access the synnax node from your local machine.

`--listen=localhost:8080` - This tells synnax to listen on port 8080 for incoming
connections. This is also the address that other nodes will use to connect when starting
a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store its data in memory, which is useful for testing
purposes.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without authenticating or encrypting requests. This
is useful for development and testing purposes, but should not be used in production.

## Connecting to the Node

Now that you have a node running, you can communicate with it using our python
client library. See the [Python Client](../client-python/get-started) page for more information.
