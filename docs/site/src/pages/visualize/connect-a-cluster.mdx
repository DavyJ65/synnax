This page will show you how to connect to a Synnax cluster using Delta.

## Prerequisites

This page assumes you've already:

1. Started a Synnax cluster.
2. Installed the Delta UI.

## Adding a New Cluster

Adding a new cluster is as simple as clicking the **Add Cluster** button in the top
right corner of the cluster toolbar and entering your connection parameters, as shown
below.

<Video client:only="react" id="visualize/connect-a-cluster" />

This will add a new cluster to the list and set it as active. Delta continuously monitors
the connection to the cluster and displays it in the bottom right corner of the UI.

## Parameters

1. Name - A human-readable name for the cluster.
2. Host - The hostname or IP address of the cluster.
3. Port - The port number of the cluster.
4. Username - The username to use when connecting to the cluster.
5. Password - The password to use when connecting to the cluster.
6. Secure - A boolean value indicating whether to use TLS when connecting to the cluster.
   This parameter only works with secure clusters.

## Switching Clusters

Changing the active cluster is as easy as double clicking on the cluster you want to
in the cluster toolbar.
