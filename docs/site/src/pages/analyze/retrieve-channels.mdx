import ClientTabs from "@/components/ClientTabs/ClientTabs.astro";

## Prerequisites

This page assumes you’ve already:

1. Started a Synnax cluster.
2. Familiarized yourself with channels, domains, arrays, and frames.
3. Know how to create channels in a cluster.

### Retrieving a Single Channel

Retrieving a single channel is easy.

```python
# By name
my_precise_tc = client.channels.retrieve("my-precise-tc")
# By key
my_precise_tc = client.channels.retrieve("1-1")
```

### Retrieving Multiple Channels

Retrieving multiple channels is also simple. All of the following queries return
the same channels.

```python
# By name
channels = client.channels.retrieve(["sensor-one", "sensor-three"])
# Also by name
channels = client.channels.retrieve("sensor-one", "sensor-three")
# By key
channels = client.channels.retrieve("1-1", "2-12")
# By key and name
channels = client.channels.retrieve("sensor-one", "2-12"),
```

Unlike retrieving a single channel, retrieving several channels will not raise a
`QueryError` when no or multiple channels are found for a given parameter. If no results
match, the method will return an empty list. Sometimes its useful to know which channel’s
weren’t found. To receive a list of parameters without a matching channel, set the
`include_not_found` argument to `True`.

```python
# Note that this returns a tuple
channels, not_found = client.channels.retrieve(
    ["sensor-one", "sensor-three", "does-not-exist"],
    include_not_found=True,
)
print(len(channels)) # 2
print(not_found) # ["does-not-exist"]
```

### Retrieving a Single Channel

Retrieving a single channel is easy.

```typescript
// By name
let myPreciseTC = client.channels.retrieve({ name: "my-precise-tc" });
// Also by name
myPreciseTC = client.channels.retrieve("my-precise-tc");

console.log(myPreciseTC.key); // 1-1

// By key
myPreciseTC = client.channels.retrieve({ key: "1-1" });
// Also by key
myPreciseTC = client.channels.retrieve("1-1");
```

If the channel is not found or multiple channels match the query parameters, the client
will raise a `synnax.QueryError`.

### Retrieving Multiple Channels

Retrieving multiple channels is also simple. All of the following queries return the same channels.

```typescript
// By name
let channels = client.channels.retrieve({ names: ["sensor-one", "sensor-two"] });
// Also by name
channels = client.channels.retrieve("sensor-one", "sensor-two");

console.log(channels.map((c) => c.key)); // ["1-1", "2-12"]

// By key
channels = client.channels.retrieve({ keys: ["1-1", "2-12"] });
// By key and name
channels = client.channels.retrieve({ names: ["sensor-one"], keys: ["2-12"] });
// Also by key and name
channels = client.channels.retrieve("sensor-one", "2-12");
```

Unlike retrieving a single channel, retrieving several channels will not raise a query
error when no or multiple channels are found for a given parameter. If no results match,
the method will return an empty list. Sometimes its useful to know which channel’s weren’t
found. To receive a list of parameters without a matching channel, set the `includeNotFound`
argument to `true`.

```typescript
const [channels, notFound] = client.channels.retrieve({
    names: ["sensor-one", "sensor-three", "does-not-exist"],
    includeNotFound: true,
});

console.log(channels.length); // 2
console.log(notFound); // ["does-not-exist"]
```
