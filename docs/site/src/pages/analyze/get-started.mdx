### Install the Python Client

The `synnax` client requires Python 3.9 or higher, and can be installed using PyPi.

```bash
pip install synnax
```

### Login to Synnax

Before reading or writing data, you need to login to a Synnax cluster. To interactively
login, simply run:

```
synnax login
```

If successful, you should see the following output:

```
Connection successful!
Saved credentials. You can now use the Synnax Client without having to log in. To connect
the cluster in a Python shell, use the following:

from synnax import Synnax
client = Synnax()
```

### Read and Plot Data

You're now free to read and write data. Take the following example,
where we read data from a temperature sensor and plot it.

```python
from datetime import datetime

import synnax as sy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Instantiate a client
client = sy.Synnax()

# Retrieve a channel containing temperature sensor data and a channel containing
# the timestamps for the readings.
temperature_sensor = client.channels.retrieve("my-temperature-sensor")
time = client.channels.retrieve("time")

# Define the start and end times for the data we want to retrieve.
start, end = datetime(2021, 1, 1), datetime(2021, 1, 2)

# Read the data from the channels.
temperatures = temperature_sensor.read(start, end)
times = time.read(start, end)

# Plot the data.
plt.plot(times, temperatures)
plt.show()
```
