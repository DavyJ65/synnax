# Start a Single Node

## Using Docker

The simplest way to start a single node cluster is by using the `synnaxlabs/synnax` Docker image,
simply run:

```bash
docker run -p 9090:9090 synnaxlabs/synnax --listen-address=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will pull the latest version of Synnax from Docker Hub and start a single node cluster with
the following parameters:

`-p 9090:9090` - This maps port 9090 on the host to port 9090 in the container. This allows
access to the Synnax node from the host machine.

`--listen-address=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on. This
is the reachable adress of the node, and is also the address that other nodes will use to
connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

## Linux

To start a single node cluster on Linux, first download the latest Synnax binary
by running:

```bash
curl -LO
```

Then, remove any previous installations and move the binary to `/usr/local/synnax/bin`:

```bash
rm -rf /usr/local/synnax && mv synnax /usr/local/synnax/bin
```

Next, add `/usr/local/synnax/bin` to your `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/synnax/bin
```

Finally, start the node:

```bash
synnax start --listen-address=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen-address=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on. This
is the reachable adress of the node, and is also the address that other nodes will use to
connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

## macOS

To start a single node cluster on macOS, first download the latest Synnax binary
by running:

```bash
curl -LO
```

Then, remove any previous installations and move the binary to `/usr/local/synnax/bin`:

```bash
rm -rf /usr/local/synnax && mv synnax /usr/local/synnax/bin
```

Next, add `/usr/local/synnax/bin` to your `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/synnax/bin
```

Finally, start the node:

```bash
synnax start --listen-address=localhost:9090 --mem --insecure
```

This will start a single node cluster with the following parameters:

`--listen-address=localhost:9090` - This sets the address that the node will listen on. This
is the reachable adress of the node, and is also the address that other nodes will use to
connect when deploying a multi-node cluster.

`--mem` - Tells the node to store all data in memory, which is useful for learning and
development.

`--insecure` - Tells the node to run without TLS.

## Windows

Unfortunately, Synnax does not support Windows yet. If you are interested in running Synnax on
Windows, let us know here. For now, we recommend using Docker or WSL along with the
instructions for Linux.

# Next Steps

Now that you have a single node cluster running, you need to configure channels and
acquire data.
