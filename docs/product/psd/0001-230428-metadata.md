# 0 - Summary

Now that we have a grip on telemetry storage, our users are asking about linking
non-time series information to their time-series data. This meta-data ranges from simple
alphanumeric key-value pairs to procedure documents and simulation results. This PRD
consolidates these requests into a set of requirements and proposes a strategy
delivering this functionality.

# 1 - Problem Statement

Providing efficient, meaningful access to hardware data is a core part of Synnax's
vision for an industrial operations platform. Without providing essential context about
the large amounts of telemetry we collect, we hamper our user's ability to quickly form
analysis and understand the systems they control. As of today, our users have
no way of linking metadata to time-series data, and must manually refer to this
information in external systems such as Excel, Google Sheets, or configuration files
in a git repository. They must also manually access the data by time-range as opposed
to by label. This has been a major pain point in the alpha version of Synnax, and
querying by meta-data has become one of the most requested, and most needed features.

## 1.0 - What is Metadata?

Time-series data (or telemetry) represents the values of a particular sensor, actuator,
or event source over time. In Synnax's case, Meta represents correlated information
about a particular group of time-series values. Metadata is related to telemetry by both
time and space i.e. _this piece of metadata relates to the telemetry we recorded between
1 and 2pm on June 14, 2023, for the channels X,Y, and Z_. The term "metadata" is quite
broad, so here are a few specific examples:

- Hardware configuration, such as part numbers, design version, and instrumentation
  diagrams.
- Test/operation procedures and notes.
- Test parameters such as volumes, masses, pressure and voltage set-points.
- Test personnel.
- Labels on interesting regions of data.

# 2 - User Research Summary

User research is the driving force behind this strategy. All of our user research can be
found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/13Vc-G5CNzCwhxx9vNsHJLECK9Mrqz0if).
As this is a public document, we've anonymized and summarized our findings below.

## 2.0 - It's painful to query by time range

Our users frequently complain that having to request data by specific time ranges is
one of the main pain points that deters them from using Synnax over a locally stored
file. In order to access relevant data, they must reference test logs, chat messages,
or other information sources to figure out when an operation was run. In many cases,
they have to start with a very broad guess and slowly refine their search, a painstaking
task. Our users want to name specific test or operations and be able to search for and
load them in by name.

## 2.1 - Permanent channel names don't work

Dynamic, fast-paced teams are constantly evolving their hardware systems, experimenting
with new sensor configurations, adding actuators and swapping out components.
Permanently setting a channel name doesn't make sense in these scenarios. During one
test your channel may be plugged into a vent valve and in another a propellant valve.
Using a generic name like `daq1-valve1` makes it difficult to figure out which channel
represents what physical entity/behavior. Our users want some way to dynamically alter
what a particular channel represents.

## 2.2 - Users are keeping metadata elsewhere

Our users are keeping critical information in:

- Physical notebooks
- Shared drives
- Excel sheets
- Chat messages
- In their heads
- Git repositories

In most cases, they choose particular tools for specific reasons, and are satisfied
with the functionality those tools provide. The issue is not the lack of software for
defining metadata, but the inability to strongly tie this meta-data to time-series data.

## 2.3 - Metadata is difficult to keep up to date

In most teams, particularly small teams, maintaining accurate accounts of software and
hardware configuration and operational procedures is remarkably challenging. Keeping
these information sources current takes a considerable amount of discipline. This means
that meta-data used in critical operations (such as auto-sequences) may be out of date.
We need to think about how we build fault tolerance surroundings ops critical metadata.

## 2.4 - Users want to query similar operations together

## 2.5 - Metadata is important across industries

## 2.0 - Alphanumeric Keys and Values

# 3 - Strategy

1. Hypothesis
2. Procedure
3. Measuring results

## 3.0 - Experiment 1 - Labeled Ranges

Hypothesis - The labeled range is the pivot around which meta-data data revolves
and is the primary means of querying time-series.

Procedure -
Implement the labeled range
Implemment a means for creating labeled ranges
Implement a means for accessing labeled ranges in a tree and search format
Implement a means for accessing labeled ranges from the python client

Measurement
User experience tests with previously dissatisfied users
User interviews after using it for a long time
Click through rates? Segment events? Probably not with this few users
Perhaps interview users in other industries

## 3.1 - Experiment 2 - Synnax is not a Primary Metadata Store

Hypothesis - Synnax should not serve as a primary means for most metadata, and should
isntead allow users to link time-series to toehr meta-data sources.

## 3.2 - Experiment 3 - Intelligent Meta data

Hypothesis - There exists targeted metadata that is broadly useful to the point where
it should be built directly into Synnax.

Procedure
Implement channel aliases
Implement channel units
